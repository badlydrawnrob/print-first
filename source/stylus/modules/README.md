# Cardinal modules

## Mixins

The `mixins` folder holds some basic mixins.

- Including an optional Material Design `baseline-grid.styl`.


## variables

Cardinal stores all of its STYLUS variables in a folder aptly named `variables`. These variables provide some good default settings for any project, but you can easily customize them to suit your needs.

- Always `$override.the.hash = 'Arial'`, not the `$defaults-`
